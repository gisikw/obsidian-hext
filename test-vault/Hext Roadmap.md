kanban-plugin: basic

---

## Backlog

- [ ] Come up with a system such that a user can manage their own terrain / symbol dictionary in settings
- [ ] Fullscreen the map on click?
- [ ] Enhance syntax to support inline links, and make those SVG elements links
- [ ] Generate point crawl from labeled points
- [ ] Generate downloadable/printable png


## Todo

- [ ] Extract the mapMap to a cache singleton
- [ ] Move SVG render of Hex into Hex
- [ ] Parse terrain labels and set Hex backgrounds accordingly
- [ ] Support Paths
- [ ] #bugfix Clear out rendered SVGs associated with a particular file on close of that file
- [ ] Render coordinates in each hex
- [ ] Render labels in each hex


## In Progress



## Done

- [ ] Figure out why the codeblockprocessor doesn't automatically update - if the snippet is changed, live-preview updates. But reading view is stuck with a cached version.
- [ ] Generate a static SVG that auto-replaces code snippets
- [ ] Add testing infrastructure
- [ ] Enable hot-reloading
